## Usage

To see example usage of the package you can use the notebook folder. An example of the usage is also given below
```python
import pandas as pd
from name_matching.name_matcher import NameMatcher

# define a dataset with bank names
df_companies_a = pd.DataFrame({'Company name': [
        'Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited',
        'China Construction Bank',
        'Agricultural Bank of China',
        'Bank of China',
        'JPMorgan Chase',
        'Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group',
        'Bank of America',
        'HSBC',
        'BNP Paribas',
        'Cr√©dit Agricole']})

# alter each of the bank names a bit to test the matching
df_companies_b = pd.DataFrame({'name': [
        'Bank of China Limited',
        'Mitsubishi Financial Group',
        'Construction Bank China',
        'Agricultural Bank',
        'Bank of Amerika',
        'BNP Parisbas',
        'JP Morgan Chase',
        'HSCB',
        'Industrial and Commercial Bank of China',
        'Credite Agricole']})

# initialise the name matcher
matcher = NameMatcher(number_of_matches=1, 
                      legal_suffixes=True, 
                      common_words=False, 
                      top_n=50, 
                      verbose=True)

# adjust the distance metrics to use
matcher.set_distance_metrics(['bag', 'typo', 'refined_soundex'])

# load the data to which the names should be matched
matcher.load_and_process_master_data(column='Company name',
                                     df_matching_data=df_companies_a, 
                                     transform=True)

# perform the name matching on the data you want matched
matches = matcher.match_names(to_be_matched=df_companies_b, 
                              column_matching='name')

# combine the datasets based on the matches
combined = pd.merge(df_companies_a, matches, how='left', left_index=True, right_on='match_index')
combined = pd.merge(combined, df_companies_b, how='left', left_index=True, right_index=True)
