# Name matching for company

Name matching is a Python package for the matching of company names. This package has been developed to match the names of companies from different databases together to allow them to be merged. The package has a number of options to determine how exact the matches should be and also for the selection of different name matching algorithms.

For a more in-depth discussion of the name matching package please see the [company name matching](https://medium.com/dnb-data-science-hub/company-name-matching-6a6330710334) medium post

## Usage

To see example usage of the package you can use the notebook folder. An example of the usage is also given below
```python
import pandas as pd
from name_matching.name_matcher import NameMatcher

# define a dataset with bank names
df_companies_a = pd.DataFrame({'Company name': [
        'Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited',
        'China Construction Bank',
        'Agricultural Bank of China',
        'Bank of China',
        'JPMorgan Chase',
        'Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group',
        'Bank of America',
        'HSBC',
        'BNP Paribas',
        'Cr√©dit Agricole']})

# alter each of the bank names a bit to test the matching
df_companies_b = pd.DataFrame({'name': [
        'Bank of China Limited',
        'Mitsubishi Financial Group',
        'Construction Bank China',
        'Agricultural Bank',
        'Bank of Amerika',
        'BNP Parisbas',
        'JP Morgan Chase',
        'HSCB',
        'Industrial and Commercial Bank of China',
        'Credite Agricole']})

# initialise the name matcher
matcher = NameMatcher(number_of_matches=1, 
                      legal_suffixes=True, 
                      common_words=False, 
                      top_n=50, 
                      verbose=True)

# adjust the distance metrics to use
matcher.set_distance_metrics(['bag', 'typo', 'refined_soundex'])

# load the data to which the names should be matched
matcher.load_and_process_master_data(column='Company name',
                                     df_matching_data=df_companies_a, 
                                     transform=True)

# perform the name matching on the data you want matched
matches = matcher.match_names(to_be_matched=df_companies_b, 
                              column_matching='name')

# combine the datasets based on the matches
combined = pd.merge(df_companies_a, matches, how='left', left_index=True, right_on='match_index')
combined = pd.merge(combined, df_companies_b, how='left', left_index=True, right_index=True)
